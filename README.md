# <universal-snippet\>

`<universal-snippet>` is bringing the web together, 1 snippet at a time.

Ever wanted to grab a piece of another website and change it automatically when it changes? Probably not, but I made something for it anyway.

## 📦 Install it

```
npm i @erikkroes/universal-snippet
```

## 🛠️ Use it 

```html
<script async type="module" src="/node_modules/@erikkroes/universal-snippet/universal-snippet.js"></script>

<universal-snippet src="your-page-url" query="a-css-selector"></universal-snippet>
```

## 🙋🏿 Some questions

### Is this safe?
Probably not.

### How does it deal with CORS and stuff like that?
Poorly.

### It looks rather hacky.
You're probably right.

### But you made it anyway?
Exactly.
